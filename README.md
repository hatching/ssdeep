# ssdeep

Golang implementation of the ssdeep algorithm.

This is a fork of [glaslos' work](https://github.com/glaslos/ssdeep) and is
originally based on the [paper](https://dfrws.org/sites/default/files/session-files/paper-identifying_almost_identical_files_using_context_triggered_piecewise_hashing.pdf)
and [implementation](https://sourceforge.net/p/ssdeep/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/fuzzy.c)
by Jesse Kornblum.

See the [example](/cmd/ssdeep/main.go) in the cmd/ssdeep/ directory for the
usage.
